<p>&#147;Hello, Garrett here. Hope you&#146;re feeling refreshed after your weekend and ready for our meeting on Monday morning?</p><p>We&#146;d like you to explain the fundamentals of IFRS 1; what are to be considered our first IFRS financial statements and when do we need to apply IFRS 1?  Could you also clarify the meaning of &#145;explicit and unreserved statement of compliance&#146;?</p><p>And concerning recognition and measurement: what is the definition of opening IFRS statement of financial position and the date of transition; and what are the rules regarding compliance with all Standards effective at the end of the reporting period?</p><p>I think it&#146;s essential to be clear on all these issues prior to preparing our financial statements under IFRS. </p><p>See you in the boardroom at 10.</p><p>Bye for now.&#148;</p></div>
